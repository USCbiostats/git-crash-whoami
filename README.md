# A Crash course on git: Who am I

This is part of the workshop located [here](https://github.com/USCbiostats/git-crash){target="_blank"}

You need to make a fork of this repository, add your name in the list below, and replace it with something like:

```md
[**@username**](https://github.com/username/) something about you
```

For example, this is what I did with mine:

> [**@gvegayon**](https://github.com/gvegayon) My first programming language was Visual Basic and before going to business school I wanted to be a musician <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/893619?s=460&u=723af9d8b02e277a5a91e0c179bbdf4450abec4b&v=4" alt="An old picture of me" width="40px">

Notice the figure of my username (that's optional and fun). This is the code I used of writing that line:

```md

```
Look for your Github username and add a link to your Github profile and something about
yourself (that you don't mind publicly sharing). Remember to only modify the line with your
username!

Once you have modified the README.md file, commit the changes,
push them to your forked repo, and create a PR.
